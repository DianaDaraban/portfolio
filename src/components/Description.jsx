        I define myself as a disciplined, balanced, dedicated and curious
        person. My greatest strength is my determination. I like being set
        goals, it helps me to feel more accomplished with the work I am doing.
        Working alongside the team, I can set new standards for myself and
        hopefully inspire the others to do the same towards our common goal. I
        tend to identify the work team I belong to as a second family, to
        actively support the team to achieve common goals and to help the
        overall evolution.<br></br>
        <p>
          Besides, I am an altruistic person and I often get involved in social
          causes and try to offer my help. Sincere and open communication,
          evolution, self-improvement and team work are important for me. I am
          passionate about coding, reading, discovering new things and sports,
          especially team sports. I think that my experience in leadership, the
          passion for coding and my determination are the elements that will
          help me obtain a favorable path in the IT field.
